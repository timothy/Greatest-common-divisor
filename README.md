# Greatest-common-divisor
This chunk of code finds the GCD for two integers or a list of numbers.  It consists of two main functions findMultiGCD and findGCD.  findMultiGCD depends on findGCD and can find 2 or more GCDs.  Look at the inline docs for more info.  The greatest common divisor is also known as the greatest common factor (gcf), highest common factor (hcf), greatest common measure (gcm), or highest common divisor.
